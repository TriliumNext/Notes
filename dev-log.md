## 2023-12-01: TypeScript Development Environment Setup

### Problem
Spent 5 days trying to set up TypeScript development environment with Docker/Podman. Main challenges were:
- File extension handling in Node.js
- TypeScript compilation vs direct execution
- Module resolution issues
- Build process complexity

### Solution
Simplified the development environment by:
1. Running TypeScript directly with ts-node and nodemon
2. Removing complex build steps
3. Focusing on developer experience with hot-reloading

### Key Changes
- Modified Dockerfile to use ts-node for development
- Removed intermediate compilation steps
- Using nodemon for file watching
- Kept development and production builds separate

### Files Modified
- `mhw.dockerfile`: Simplified for development
- `tsconfig.json`: Updated types path
- `run-notes.ps1`: Updated container configuration
