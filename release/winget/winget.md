# ./release/winget

These yaml files are documentation/examples in case the Winget package installer manifest needs to be rebuilt. The authoritative files are at https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/t/TriliumNext/Notes

It took ~1.5 hours for a new manifest & release binaries to pass the Winget validation CI, and at least 2 hours after that before it was available for install. I don't know if it'll be like that every time.
