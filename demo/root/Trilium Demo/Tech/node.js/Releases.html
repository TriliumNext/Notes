        <p>New major releases of Node.js are cut from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> master
          branch every six months. Even-numbered versions are cut in April and odd-numbered
          versions are cut in October. When a new odd version is released, the previous
          even version undergoes transition to Long Term Support (LTS), which gives
          that version 18 months of active support from the date it is designated
          LTS.</p>
