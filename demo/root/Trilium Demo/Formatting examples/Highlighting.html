        <p><span class="text-big">Space Shuttle Discovery</span> (Orbiter Vehicle
          Designation: <code>OV-103</code>) is one of the orbiters from NASA's Space
          Shuttle program and the third of five fully operational orbiters to be
          built. Its first mission, STS-41-D, flew from August 30 to September 5,
          1984. Over 27 years of service it launched and landed <span style="background-color:hsl(60,75%,60%);">39 times</span>,
          gathering more spaceflights than any other spacecraft to date. The shuttle
          has three main components: the Space Shuttle orbiter, a central fuel tank,
          and two rocket boosters. Nearly <span style="background-color:hsl(120,75%,60%);">25,000 heat resistant tiles</span> cover
          the orbiter to protect it from high temperatures on re-entry.</p>
        <p>Discovery became the third operational orbiter to enter service, preceded
          by Columbia and Challenger. <span style="color:hsl(270,75%,60%);">It embarked on its last mission, STS-133, on February 24, 2011</span> and
          touched down for the final time at Kennedy Space Center on March 9, having
          spent a cumulative total of almost a full year in space. Discovery performed
          both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions,
          and also carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.</p>
