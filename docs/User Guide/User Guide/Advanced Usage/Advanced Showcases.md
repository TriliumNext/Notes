# Advanced Showcases
Trilium offers advanced functionality through [Scripts](../Scripting.md) and [Promoted Attributes](Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.md). To illustrate these features, we've prepared several showcases available in the [demo notes](Database.md):

*   [Relation Map](../Note%20Types/Relation%20Map.md)
*   [Day Notes](Advanced%20Showcases/Day%20Notes.md)
*   [Weight Tracker](Advanced%20Showcases/Weight%20Tracker.md)
*   [Task Manager](Advanced%20Showcases/Task%20Manager.md)

It's important to note that these examples are not natively supported by Trilium out of the box; instead, they demonstrate what you can build within Trilium.
