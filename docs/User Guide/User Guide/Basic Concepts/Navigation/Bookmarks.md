# Bookmarks
To easily access selected notes, you can bookmark them. See demo:

## Bookmark folder

Space in the left panel is limited, and you might want to bookmark many items. One possible solution is to bookmark a folder, so it shows its children:

To do this, you need to add a `#bookmarkFolder` label to the note.
