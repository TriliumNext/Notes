# Note Map
A Note map is a note type which displays a standalone version of the feature of the same name:Â [Note Map (Link map, Tree map)](../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20Map%20\(Link%20map%2C%20Tree%20map\).md).

Once created, the note map will display the relations between notes. Only the notes that are part of the parent of the note map will be displayed (including their children).
