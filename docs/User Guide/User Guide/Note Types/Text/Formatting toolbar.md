# Formatting toolbar
Trilium allows two different editing experiences for text notes, based on your preference.

To do so, go to [Options](../../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Options.md) and look for the _Text Notes_ section. There is a corresponding section called _Formatting toolbar_.

## Floating

The floating bar is a more minimalist option, in which the formatting is hidden behind two different popups.

### Block-level popup

The first popup is the block-level popup. This will appear to the left of the current paragraph you are currently editing, as a sequence of dots:

Clicking this popup will reveal the formatting options that are specific to the entire paragraph, such as setting a heading, lists, tables, etc.

### Inline popup

The inline popup appears automatically when selecting a text:

All the options here apply only to the selected portion of text, such as changing the font size, or making the text bold.

## Fixed

The fixed formatting offers a more traditional editing paradigm, usually useful if a lot of formatting is needed.

All the options are combined into a single toolbar that will appear as part of the [Ribbon](../../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Ribbon.md).

By default, if the toolbar does not fit on the screen, the rest of the options will be grouped into a single option at the end. It is possible to display items on multiple lines by checking the corresponding option in the _Formatting toolbar_ section.
