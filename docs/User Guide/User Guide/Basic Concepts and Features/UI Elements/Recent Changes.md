## Accessing the recent changes

*   For an overview of the changes across all documents, press the <img src="Recent Changes_image.png" width="25" height="21"> button in the <a class="reference-link" href="Launch%20Bar.md">Launch Bar</a>.
    *   If there is a [hoisted note](../Navigation/Note%20Hoisting.md) or a [workspace](../Navigation/Workspaces.md), the list of recent changes will be limited to the descendents of the hoisted note, or the workspace.
*   To limit the list of recent changes to a note and its descendants, look for the corresponding option in the <a class="reference-link" href="Note%20Tree/Note%20tree%20contextual%20menu.md">Note tree contextual menu</a> → Advanced.

## Interaction

*   Notes which were changed will appear in reverse chronological order (latest update first).
*   The title of the note is displayed, as well as the note path. Clicking on the note title will dismiss the dialog and navigate to that particular note.
*   Deleted notes will also be listed here, at their time of deletion. Press the _Undelete_ link next to them in order to recover them.
