# Notes
Note is a central entity in Trilium. Main attributes of note are title and content.

### Note types

The main note type is a rich-text note type called <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Text.md">Text</a>. For diagrams and drawing there is <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Canvas.md">Canvas</a> and <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Mermaid%20Diagrams.md">Mermaid Diagrams</a>.

There are also more complex note types such as <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Saved%20Search.md">Saved Search</a>, <a class="reference-link" href="../Note%20Types/Render%20Note.md">Render Note</a> that usually go hand-in-hand with <a class="reference-link" href="../Scripting.md">Scripting</a>.

In Trilium there's no specific "folder" note type. Any note can have children and thus be a folder.

### Root note

There's one special note called "root note" which is root of the note tree. All other notes are placed below it in the structure.

### Tree structure

Importantly, note itself doesn't carry information on its placement in note tree. See <a class="reference-link" href="Notes/Cloning%20Notes.md">Cloning Notes</a> for details.

Tree structure of notes can resemble file system - but compared to that notes in Trilium can act as both file and directory - meaning that note can both have its own content and have children. "Leaf note" is a note which doesn't have any children.

### Deleting / undeleting notes

When you delete a note in Trilium, it is actually only marked for deletion (soft-delete) - the actual content, title, attributes etc. are not deleted, only hidden.

Within (by default) 7 days, it is possible to undelete these soft-deleted notes - open the <a class="reference-link" href="UI%20Elements/Recent%20Changes.md">Recent Changes</a> dialog, and you will see a list of all modified notes including the deleted ones. Notes available for undeletion have a link to do so. This is kind of "trash can" functionality known from e.g. Windows.

Clicking an undelete will recover the note, it's content and attributes - note should be just as before being deleted. This action will also undelete note's children which have been deleted in the same action.

To be able to undelete a note, it is necessary that deleted note's parent must be undeleted (otherwise there's no place where we can undelete it to). This might become a problem when you delete more notes in succession - the solution is then undelete in the reverse order of your deletion.

After the 7 days (configurable) the notes will be "erased" - their title, content, revisions and attributes will be erased, and it will not be possible anymore to recover them (unless you restore a <a class="reference-link" href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Backup.md">Backup</a>).
