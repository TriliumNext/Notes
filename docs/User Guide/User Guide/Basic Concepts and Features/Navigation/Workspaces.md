# Workspaces
Workspace is a concept built up on top of [note hoisting](Note%20Hoisting.md). It is based on the idea that a user has several distinct spheres of interest. An example might be "Personal" and "Work", these two spheres are quite distinct and don't interact together. When I focus on Work, I don't really care about personal notes.

So far workspace consists of these features:

*   [note hoisting](Note%20Hoisting.md) - you can "zoom" into a workspace subtree to focus only on the relevant notes
*   easy entering of workspace:Â

*   visual identification of workspace in tabs:
