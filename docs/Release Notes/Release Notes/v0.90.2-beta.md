## ‚ú® Technical Improvements

Important changes:

*   The biggest change is that the server has been ported from Common.js to ES Modules. Note that a change of this proportion is bound to cause some quirks throughout the application, bug reports are welcome.
*   Updated Electron from 25.9.8 to 31.2.1 ([#231](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/231))

Additionally:

*   Updated CKEditor from 41.0.0 to 41.4.2.
*   Started adding support for internationalization ([#248](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/248)). The application will soon be able to be translated into multiple languages.
*   Improved error management for scripting:
    *   If a critical unexpected error occurs from a widget, a toast is shown explaining the situation and advising to enter safe mode, as opposed to a blank page.
    *   If a basic widget fails to render, a toast is shown instead of crashing the application.
*   Toast messages now support newlines (by adding a `\n` to the message) for slightly better formatting.
