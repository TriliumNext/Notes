# v0.91.1-beta
## üí° Key highlights

*   The launcher bar can now be placed at the top instead of the left of the screen, with a full-width tab bar. See [#654](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/654) for more information.
*   [A new theme is introduced called ‚ÄúTriliumNext"](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/661) by @adoriandoran and @eliandoran. Settings on this theme are now displayed in a card layout. Redesigned tree action buttons.
*   [Native title bar buttons](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/pull/702) when native title bar is off for Windows and macOS.

Unfortunately, it is plagued by a few bugs with Electron (the library we are using for the desktop application), see the link for more information.
*   Updated Docker builds to Node 22. **Be on the lookout for any potential issues, especially for less-tested platforms such as ARM.**
