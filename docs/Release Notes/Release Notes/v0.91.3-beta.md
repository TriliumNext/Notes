# v0.91.3-beta
## üí° Key highlights

*   Quite a few mobile improvements have been done (**kindly waiting for bug reports**)
    *   On mobile the horizontal layout (with the launcher bar displayed at the top of the screen instead of on the left side) is now enforced.
        *   This allows for more real estate for the content of the note and simplifies the mobile layout.
    *   The launch bar has also been moved at the bottom, to be inline with modern application layouts.
    *   Restructured the tree as a sidebar which is triggered via a button on the left side of the title bar.
    *   The sidebar can also be triggered by swiping to the right on the left side of the screen. _Still some quirks to address on both iOS and Android due to their weird back button gesture_.
    *   Improved the positioning of the bottom bar and of the editor toolbar.
    *   Tabs have been enabled. Currently we are using the same implementation as on desktop, which might have a few quirks on mobile.
    *   Jump to note is now available.
    *   The mobile view now has its own launch bar configuration with its own launch bar buttons. For now only a few have been enabled. **Feel free to request any button from the desktop should you require it.**
    *   Now it's possible to insert footnotes in CKEditor, thanks to a fork of [ThomasAitken/ckeditor5-footnotes](https://github.com/ThomasAitken/ckeditor5-footnotes).
    *   It's also possible to create inline Mermaid diagrams into text notes.

## Known issues

*   On mobile, opening in a new tab activates the new tab but does not refresh the tab bar.
