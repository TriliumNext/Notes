# v0.90.7-beta
## ⚠️ Important notes

*   0.90.5-beta & 0.90.6-beta have an incompatibility with older sync servers if using mind maps, causing them to get turned to a file. If you are impacted by this, see [mindmap note suddenly show with file note](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/issues/467#issuecomment-2402853189).
*   Sync version has been increased from 32 to 33 to prevent issues with mindmap notes. This means that the server also needs to be updated to this version, otherwise sync will be refused.
