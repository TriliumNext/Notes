# v0.92.5-beta
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The database version has been increased due to the multi-factor authentication mechanism. This means that both the desktop clients and server need to be on this version in order for synchronization to work.

## üí° Key highlights

*   Windows binaries are now signed, so there will be no more ‚Äúuntrusted application‚Äù popups appearing when starting the application for the first time after an update. Many thanks to [deajan](https://github.com/deajan) from NetPerfect for helping us with the EV certificate and the infrastructure.
*   For the desktop application, it's now possible to set a locale to change the number or date format for places such as promoted attributes.
