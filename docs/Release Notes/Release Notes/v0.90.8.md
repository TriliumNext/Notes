# v0.90.8
## 💡 Key highlights

*   A new note type was introduced called “Mind Map” using the MindElixir library.
*   Sync version has been increased from 32 to 33 to prevent issues with mindmap notes. This means that the server also needs to be updated to this version, otherwise sync will be refused.
*   Internationalization support (Spanish, Chinese, Romanian, French).
