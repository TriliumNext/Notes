# v0.90.6-beta
This is a Docker-only re-release of [v0.90.5-beta](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/releases/tag/v0.90.6-beta) that **adds back the amd64 container image** which was previously not available due to a race condition on our build mechanism. For now, this means that the Alpine container mentioned in the previous release is no longer available, as we have fallen back to Debian Slim.
