<p>Text notes can "include" another note as a read-only widget. This can
  be useful for e.g. including a dynamically generated chart (from scripts
  &amp; "render HTML" note) or other more advanced use cases.</p>
<h2>Including a note</h2>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="#root/_help_nRhnJkTT8cPs">Formatting toolbar</a>,
  look for the
  <img src="Include Note_image.png">button. There is also a keyboard shortcut defined for it but it is not
  allocated by default.</p>
