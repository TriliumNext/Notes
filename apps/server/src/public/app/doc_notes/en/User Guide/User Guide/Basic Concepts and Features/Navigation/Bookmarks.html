<p>To easily access selected notes, you can bookmark them. See demo:</p>
<p>

<h2>Bookmark folder</h2>
<p>Space in the left panel is limited, and you might want to bookmark many
  items. One possible solution is to bookmark a folder, so it shows its children:</p>
<p>
  <img src="Bookmarks_bookmark-folder.png">
</p>
<p>To do this, you need to add a <code>#bookmarkFolder</code> label to the
  note.</p>
