[Network]
# host setting is relevant only for web deployments - set the host on which the server will listen

# port setting is relevant only for web deployments, desktop builds run on a fixed port (changeable with TRILIUM_PORT environment variable)

# setting to give trust to reverse proxies, a comma-separated list of trusted rev. proxy IPs can be specified (CIDR notation is permitted),
# alternatively 'true' will make use of the leftmost IP in X-Forwarded-For, ultimately an integer can be used to tell about the number of hops between
# Trilium (which is hop 0) and the first trusted rev. proxy. 
# once set, expressjs will use the X-Forwarded-For header set by the rev. proxy to determinate the real IPs of clients.
# expressjs shortcuts are supported: loopback(127.0.0.1/8, ::1/128), linklocal(169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10), uniquelocal(10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7)

# Default value is 1814400 Seconds, which is 21 Days.
