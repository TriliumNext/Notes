        <p>I enjoyed this book a lot. It's slow moving at times with the author taking
          his time with conversations and descriptions of them. The premise is very
          interesting, but I'm sad that it wasn't elaborated more deeply - e.g. the
          history and development of the clakker technology with Huygens and how
          Spinoza comes into the picture. Maybe the author saves it for the next
          two parts of the book.</p>
        <p>Language can be intimidating at first for non-native english speakers
          - author uses wide range of vocabulary. Fortunately it gets better after
          a while as reader adjusts.</p>
