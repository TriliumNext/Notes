        <h2>macOS support</h2>
        <p>Originally, Trilium Notes considered the macOS build unsupported. TriliumNext
          commits to make the experience on macOS as good as possible.</p>
        <p>if you find any platform-specific issues, feel free to <a href="Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.html">report them</a>.</p>
        <h2>Translation / localisation support</h2>
        <p>The original Trilium Notes application did not support multiple languages.
          Since we believe that internationalisation is a core part of an application,
          we have added support for it.</p>
        <p>Contributions to translations are welcome.</p>
        <h2>Multi-user support</h2>
        <p>Common request is to allow multiple users collaborate, share notes etc.
          So far I'm resisting this because of these reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it's a huge feature, or rather a Pandora's box of collaboration features
            like user management, permissions, conflict resolution, real-time editing
            of a note by multiple people etc. This would be a huge amount of work.
            Trilium Notes is project made mostly by one person in free time and that's
            unlikely to change in the future.</li>
          <li>given its size it would probably pivot the attention away from my main
            focus which is a personal note-taking</li>
          <li>the assumption that only single person has access to the app simplifies
            many things, or just outright makes them possible. In multi-user app, our
            <a
            href="Note%20Types/Code/Scripts.html">scripting</a>support would be a XSS security hole, while with the single
              user assumption it's an endless customizable tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to open multiple documents in one Trilium instance</h2>
        <p>This is normally not supported - one Trilium process can open only a single
          instance of a <a href="Advanced%20Usage/Database.html">database</a>. However,
          you can run two Trilium processes (from one installation), each connected
          to a separate document. To achieve this, you need to set a location for
          the <a href="Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">data directory</a> in
          the <code>TRILIUM_DATA_DIR</code> environment variable and separate port
          on <code>TRILIUM_PORT</code> environment variable. How to do that depends
          on the platform, in Unix-based systems you can achieve that by running
          command such as this:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">TRILIUM_DATA_DIR=/home/me/path/to/data/dir TRILIUM_PORT=12345 trilium </code></pre>
        <p>You can save this command into a <code>.sh</code> script file or make an
          alias. Do this similarly for a second instance with different data directory
          and port.</p>
        <h2>Can I use Dropbox / Google Drive / OneDrive to sync data across multiple computers.</h2>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>These general purpose sync apps are not suitable to sync database files
          which are open and being worked on by another application. The result is
          that they will corrupt the database file, resulting in data loss and this
          message in the Trilium logs:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">SqliteError: database disk image is malformed</code></pre>
        <p>The only supported way to sync Trilium's data across the network is to
          use a <a href="Installation%20%26%20Setup/Synchronization.html">sync/web server</a>.</p>
        <h2>Why database instead of flat files?</h2>
        <p>Trilium stores notes in a <a href="Advanced%20Usage/Database.html">database</a> which
          is an SQLite database. People often ask why doesn't Trilium rather use
          flat files for note storage - it's fair question since flat files are easily
          interoperable, work with SCM/git etc.</p>
        <p>Short answer is that file systems are simply not powerful enough for what
          we want to achieve with Trilium. Using filesystem would mean fewer features
          with probably more problems.</p>
        <p>More detailed answer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Cloning%20Notes.html">clones</a> are
            what you might call "hard directory link" in filesystem lingo, but this
            concept is not implemented in any filesystem</li>
          <li>filesystems make a distinction between directory and file while there's
            intentionally no such difference in Trilium</li>
          <li>files are stored in no particular order and user can't change this</li>
          <li>Trilium allows storing note <a href="Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">attributes</a> which
            could be represented in extended user attributes but their support differs
            greatly among different filesystems / operating systems</li>
          <li>Trilium makes links / relations between different notes which can be quickly
            retrieved / navigated (e.g. for <a href="Advanced%20Usage/Note%20Map%20(Link%20map%2C%20Tree%20map).html">note map</a>).
            There's no such support in file systems which means these would have to
            be stored in some kind of side-car files (mini-databases).</li>
          <li>Filesystems are generally not transactional. While this is not completely
            required for a note-taking application, having transactions make it way
            easier to keep notes and their metadata in predictable and consistent state.</li>
