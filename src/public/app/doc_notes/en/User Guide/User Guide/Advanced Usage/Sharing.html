      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Trilium allows you to share selected notes as <strong>publicly accessible</strong> read-only
          documents. This feature is particularly useful for publishing content directly
          from your Trilium notes, making it accessible to others online.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>To use the sharing feature, you must have a <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Server%20Installation.html">server installation</a> of
          Trilium. This is necessary because the notes will be hosted from the server.</p>
        <h2>How to Share a Note</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Enable Sharing</strong>: To share a note, toggle the <code>Shared</code> switch
              within the note's interface. Once sharing is enabled, an URL will appear,
              which you can click to access the shared note.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Access the Shared Note</strong>: The link provided will open the
              note in your browser. If your server is not configured with a public IP,
              the URL will refer to <code>localhost (127.0.0.1)</code>.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Sharing a Note Subtree</h2>
        <p>When you share a note, you actually share the entire subtree of notes
          beneath it. If the note has child notes, they will also be included in
          the shared content. For example, sharing the "Formatting" subtree will
          display a page with basic navigation for exploring all the notes within
          that subtree.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/share-multiple-notes-web.png" alt="Shared Subtree Example">
        </p>
        <h2>Viewing All Shared Notes</h2>
        <p>You can view a list of all shared notes by clicking on "Show Shared Notes
          Subtree." This allows you to manage and navigate through all the notes
          you have made public.</p>
        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>Shared notes are published on the open internet and can be accessed by
          anyone with the URL. The URL's randomness does not provide security, so
          it is crucial not to share sensitive information through this feature.</p>
        <h3>Password Protection</h3>
        <p>To protect shared notes with a username and password, you can use the <code>#shareCredentials</code> attribute.
          Add this label to the note with the format <code>#shareCredentials="username:password"</code>.
          To protect an entire subtree, make sure the label is <a href="Attributes/Attribute%20Inheritance.html">inheritable</a>.</p>
        <h2>Advanced Sharing Options</h2>
        <h3>Customizing the Appearance of Shared Notes</h3>
        <p>The default shared page is basic in design, but you can customize it using
          your own CSS:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custom CSS</strong>: Link a CSS <a href="../Note%20Types/Code.html">code note</a> to
            the shared page by adding a <code>~shareCss</code> relation to the note.
            If you want this style to apply to the entire subtree, make the label inheritable.
            You can hide the CSS code note from the tree navigation by adding the <code>#shareHiddenFromTree</code> label.</li>
          <li><strong>Omitting Default CSS</strong>: For extensive styling changes,
            use the <code>#shareOmitDefaultCss</code> label to avoid conflicts with Trilium's
            <a
            href="../Basic%20Concepts/Themes.html">default stylesheet</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Adding JavaScript</h3>
        <p>You can inject custom JavaScript into the shared note using the <code>~shareJs</code> relation.
          This allows you to access note attributes or traverse the note tree using
          the <code>fetchNote()</code> API, which retrieves note data based on its
          ID.</p>
        <p>Example:</p><pre><code class="language-application-javascript-env-backend">const currentNote = await fetchNote();
const parentNote = await fetchNote(currentNote.parentNoteIds[0]);

for (const attr of parentNote.attributes) {
    console.log(attr.type, attr.name, attr.value);
}</code></pre>
        <h3>Creating Human-Readable URL Aliases</h3>
        <p>Shared notes typically have URLs like <code>http://domain.tld/share/knvU8aJy4dJ7</code>,
          where the last part is the note's ID. You can make these URLs more user-friendly
          by adding the <code>#shareAlias</code> label to individual notes (e.g., <code>#shareAlias=highlighting</code>).
          This will change the URL to <code>http://domain.tld/share/highlighting</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ensure that aliases are unique.</li>
          <li>Using slashes (<code>/</code>) within aliases to create subpaths is not
            supported.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Viewing and Managing Shared Notes</h3>
        <p>All shared notes are grouped under an automatically managed "Shared Notes"
          section. From here, you can view, share, or unshare notes by moving or
          cloning them within this section.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/shared-list.png" alt="Shared Notes List">
        </p>
        <h3>Setting a Custom Favicon</h3>
        <p>To customize the favicon for your shared pages, create a relation <code>~shareFavicon</code> pointing
          to a file note containing the favicon (e.g., in <code>.ico</code> format).</p>
        <h3>Sharing a Note as the Root</h3>
        <p>You can designate a specific note or folder as the root of your shared
          content by adding the <code>#shareRoot</code> label. This note will be linked
          when visiting <code>[http://domain.tld/share](http://domain/share)</code>,
          making it easier to use Trilium as a fully-fledged website. Consider combining
          this with the <code>#shareIndex</code> label, which will display a list of
          all shared notes.</p>
        <h2>Additional Options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Raw Note Sharing</strong>: Use the <code>#shareRaw</code> label
            to share a note without any HTML wrapper.</li>
          <li><strong>Disallow Robot Indexing</strong>: Add the <code>#shareDisallowRobotIndexing</code> label
            to prevent search engines from indexing the shared page by including a <code>noindex, follow</code> meta
            tag and <code>X-Robots-Tag: noindex</code> header.</li>
          <li><strong>Shared Notes Index</strong>: For text notes with the <code>#shareIndex</code> label,
            the content will display a list of all shared note roots.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>While the sharing feature is powerful, it has some limitations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Relation Map Support</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Book Notes</strong>: Only show a list of child notes.</li>
          <li><strong>Code Notes</strong>: No syntax highlighting.</li>
          <li><strong>Static Note Tree</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Protected Notes</strong>: Cannot be shared.</li>
          <li><strong>Include Notes</strong>: Not supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of these limitations may be addressed in future updates.</p>
