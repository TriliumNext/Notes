      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Task Manager is a <a href="../Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.html">promoted attributes</a> and
          <a
          href="../../Note%20Types/Code/Scripts.html">scripts</a>showcase present in the <a href="../Database.html">demo notes</a>.</p>
        <h2>Demo</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="../../Attachments/task-manager.png">
        </p>
        <p>Task Manager manages outstanding (TODO) tasks and finished tasks (non-empty
          doneDate attribute). Outstanding tasks are further categorized by location
          and arbitrary tags - whenever you change tag attribute in the task note,
          this task is then automatically moved to appropriate location.</p>
        <p>Task Manager also integrates with <a href="Day%20Notes.html">day notes</a> -
          notes are <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/Note/Cloning%20Notes.html">cloned</a> into
          day note to both todoDate note and doneDate note (with <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/Navigation/Tree%20Concepts.html">prefix</a> of
          either "TODO" or "DONE").</p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>New tasks are created in the TODO note which has <code>~child:template</code> 
          <a
          href="../Attributes.html">relation</a>(see <a href="../Attributes/Attribute%20Inheritance.html">attribute inheritance</a>)
            pointing to the task template.</p>
        <h3>Attributes</h3>
        <p>Task template defines several <a href="../Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.html">promoted attributes</a> -
          todoDate, doneDate, tags, location. Importantly it also defines <code>~runOnAttributeChange</code> relation
          - <a href="../../Note%20Types/Code/Events.html">event</a> handler which is
          run on attribute change. This <a href="../../Note%20Types/Code/Scripts.html">script</a> handles
          when e.g. we fill out the doneDate attribute - meaning the task is done
          and should be moved to "Done" note and removed from TODO, locations and
          tags.</p>
        <h3>New task button</h3>
        <p>There's also "button" note which contains simple script which adds a button
          to create new note (task) in the TODO note.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">api.addButtonToToolbar({
    title: 'New task',
    icon: 'check',
    shortcut: 'alt+n',
    action: async () =&gt; {
        // creating notes is backend (server) responsibility so we need to pass
        // the control there
        const taskNoteId = await api.runOnBackend(async () =&gt; {
            const todoRootNote = await api.getNoteWithLabel('taskTodoRoot');
            const {note} = await api.createNote(todoRootNote.noteId, 'new task', '');

            return note.noteId;
        });

        // we got an ID of newly created note and we want to immediatelly display it
        await api.activateNewNote(taskNoteId);
    }
});</code></pre>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>In the demo screenshot above you may notice that TODO tasks are in red
          color and DONE tasks are green.</p>
        <p>This is done by having this CSS <a href="../../Note%20Types/Code.html">code note</a> which
          defines extra CSS classes:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">span.fancytree-node.todo .fancytree-title {
    color: red !important;
}

span.fancytree-node.done .fancytree-title {
    color: green !important;
}</code></pre>
        <p>This <a href="../../Note%20Types/Code.html">code note</a> has <code>#appCss</code> 
          <a
          href="../Attributes.html">label</a>which is recognized by Trilium on startup and loaded as CSS into
            the application.</p>
        <p>Second part of this functionality is based in event handler described
          above which assigns <code>#cssClass</code> label to the task to either "done"
          or "todo" based on the task status.</p>
