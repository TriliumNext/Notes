      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Your Trilium data is stored in a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database
          which contains all notes, tree structure, metadata, and most of the configuration.
          The database file is named <code>document.db</code> and is stored in the
          application's default <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">Data directory</a>.</p>
        <h2>Demo Notes</h2>
        <p>When you run Trilium for the first time, it will generate a new database
          containing demo notes. These notes showcase its many features, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="../Note%20Types/Relation%20Map.html">Relation Map</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="Advanced%20Showcases/Day%20Notes.html">Day Notes</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="Advanced%20Showcases/Weight%20Tracker.html">Weight Tracker</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="Advanced%20Showcases/Task%20Manager.html">Task Manager</a>
          </li>
          <li><a href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Themes.html">Custom CSS Themes</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Restoring Demo Notes</h3>
        <p>There are some cases in which you may want to restore the original demo
          notes. For example, if you experimented with some of the more advanced
          features and want to see the original reference, or if you simply want
          to explore the latest version of the demo notes, which might showcase new
          features.</p>
        <p>You can easily restore the demo notes by using Trilium's built-in import
          feature by importing them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/raw/develop/db/demo.zip">this .zip archive</a> with
            the latest version of the demo notes</li>
          <li>Right click on any note in your tree under which you would like the demo
            notes to be imported</li>
          <li>Click "Import into note"</li>
          <li>Select the .zip archive to import it</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Manually Modifying the Database</h2>
        <p>Trilium provides a lot of flexibility, and with it, opportunities for
          advanced users to tweak it. If you need to explore or modify the database
          directly, you can use a tool such as <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">SQLite Browser</a> to
          work directly on the database file.</p>
        <p>See <a href="Database/Manually%20altering%20the%20database.html">Manually altering the database</a> for
          more information.</p>
        <h2>How to Reset the Database</h2>
        <p>If you are experimenting with Trilium and want to return it to its original
          state, you can do that by deleting the current database. When you restart
          the application, it will generate a new database containing the original
          demo notes.</p>
        <p>To delete the database, simply go to the <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">data directory</a> and
          delete the <code>document.db</code> file (and any other files starting with <code>document.db</code>).</p>
        <p>If you do not need to preserve any configurations that might be stored
          in the <code>config.ini</code> file, you can just delete all of the <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">data directory's</a> contents
          to fully restore the application to its original state. You can also review
          the <a href="Configuration%20(config.ini%20or%20e.html">configuration</a> file
          to provide all <code>config.ini</code> values as environment variables instead.</p>
