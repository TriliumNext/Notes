        <p>This document outlines the steps required to upgrade Trilium to a new
          release version.</p>
        <h2>How to Upgrade</h2>
        <p>Trilium does not support built-in automatic upgrades; all updates must
          be performed manually. The upgrade process varies depending on the installation
          method:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="Server%20Installation/1.%20Installing%20the%20server/Docker%20Server%20Installation.html"><strong>Docker Server Installation</strong></a>:
            Pull the new image and restart the container.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Installations</strong>: Download the latest version from
            the <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes/releases/latest">release page</a> and
            replace the existing application files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Database Compatibility and Migration</h2>
        <p>Upon startup, Trilium will automatically migrate the <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Database.html">database</a> to
          the new version. Note that after migration, older versions of Trilium will
          be unable to read the database. If you need to revert to a previous version
          of Trilium and its database, you can restore the <a href="Backup.html">backup</a> that
          is created prior to migration.</p>
        <h2>Sync Compatibility</h2>
        <p>The <a href="Synchronization.html">synchronization</a> protocol used by
          Trilium is versioned, requiring all members of the sync cluster to use
          the same protocol version. Therefore, when upgrading to a new version,
          you may need to upgrade all instances in the sync cluster. Changes to the
          sync protocol version are typically indicated on the release page.</p>
