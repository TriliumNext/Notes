        <p>Configuring TLS is essential for <a href="../Server%20Installation.html">server installation</a> in
          Trilium. This guide details the steps to set up TLS within Trilium itself.</p>
        <p>For a more robust solution, consider using TLS termination with a reverse
          proxy (recommended, e.g., Nginx). You can follow a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-20-04">guide like this</a> for
          such setups.</p>
        <h2>Obtaining a TLS Certificate</h2>
        <p>You have two options for obtaining a TLS certificate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recommended</strong>: Obtain a TLS certificate signed by a root
            certificate authority. For personal use, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a> is
            an excellent choice. It is free, automated, and straightforward. Certbot
            can facilitate automatic TLS setup.</li>
          <li>Generate a self-signed certificate. This option is not recommended due
            to the additional complexity of importing the certificate into all machines
            connecting to the server.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Modifying <code>config.ini</code></h2>
        <p>Once you have your certificate, modify the <code>config.ini</code> file
          in the <a href="../Data%20directory.html">data directory</a> to configure
          Trilium to use it:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">[Network]
port=8080
# Set to true for TLS/SSL/HTTPS (secure), false for HTTP (insecure).
https=true
# Path to the certificate (run "bash bin/generate-cert.sh" to generate a self-signed certificate).
# Relevant only if https=true
certPath=/[username]/.acme.sh/[hostname]/fullchain.cer
keyPath=/[username]/.acme.sh/[hostname]/example.com.key</code></pre>
        <p>You can also review the <a href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Configuration%20(config.ini%20or%20e.html">configuration</a> file
          to provide all <code>config.ini</code> values as environment variables instead.</p>
        <p>The above example shows how this is set up in an environment where the
          certificate was generated using Let's Encrypt's ACME utility. Your paths
          may differ. For Docker installations, ensure these paths are within a volume
          or another directory accessible by the Docker container, such as <code>/home/node/trilium-data/[DIR IN DATA DIRECTORY]</code>.</p>
        <p>After configuring <code>config.ini</code>, restart Trilium and access the
          hostname using "https".</p>
        <h2>Self-Signed Certificate</h2>
        <p>If you opt to use a self-signed certificate for your server instance,
          note that the desktop instance will not trust it by default.</p>
        <p>To bypass this, disable certificate validation by setting the following
          environment variable (for Linux):</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
trilium</code></pre>
        <p>Trilium provides scripts to start in this mode, such as <code>trilium-no-cert-check.bat</code> for
          Windows.</p>
        <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Disabling TLS certificate validation is insecure.
          Proceed only if you fully understand the implications.</p>
