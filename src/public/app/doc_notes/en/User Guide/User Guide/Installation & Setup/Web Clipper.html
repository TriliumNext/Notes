        <p>Trilium Web Clipper is a web browser extension which allows user to clip
          text, screenshots, whole pages and short notes and save them directly to
          Trilium Notes.</p>
        <p>Project is hosted <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/web-clipper">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Firefox and Chrome are supported browsers, but the chrome build should
          work on other chromium based browsers as well.</p>
        <h2>Functionality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>select text and clip it with the right-click context menu</li>
          <li>click on an image or link and save it through context menu</li>
          <li>save whole page from the popup or context menu</li>
          <li>save screenshot (with crop tool) from either popup or context menu</li>
          <li>create short text note from popup</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trilium will save these clippings as a new child note under a "clipper
          inbox" note.</p>
        <p>By default, that's the <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Advanced%20Showcases/Day%20Notes.html">day note</a> but
          you can override that by setting the <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes.html">label</a>  <code>clipperInbox</code>,
          on any other note.</p>
        <p>If there's multiple clippings from the same page (and on the same day),
          then they will be added to the same note.</p>
        <p><strong>Extension is available from:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/web-clipper/releases">Project release page</a> -
            .xpi for Firefox and .zip for Chromium based browsers.</li>
          <li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/trilium-web-clipper/dfhgmnfclbebfobmblelddiejjcijbjm">Chrome Web Store</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>The extension needs to connect to a running Trilium instance. By default,
          it scans a port range on the local computer to find a desktop Trilium instance.</p>
        <p>It's also possible to configure the <a href="Server%20Installation.html">server</a> address
          if you don't run the desktop application, or want it to work without the
          desktop application running.</p>
        <h2>Username</h2>
        <p>Older versions of Trilium (before 0.50) required username &amp; password
          to authenticate, but this is no longer the case. You may enter anything
          in that field, it will not have any effect.</p>
