        <p>One of the Trilium's goals is to provide fast and comfortable navigation
          between notes.</p>
        <h2>Backwards and forward</h2>
        <p>You can use alt-left and alt-right to move back and forward in history
          of viewed pages.</p>
        <p>This works identically to browser backwards / forwards, it's actually
          using built-in browser support for this.</p>

        <h2>Jump to note</h2>
        <p>This is useful to quickly find and view arbitrary note - click on <code>Jump to</code> button
          on the top or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> . Then type part of the
          note name and autocomplete will help you pick the desired note.</p>

        <h3>Recent notes</h3>
        <p>Jump to note also has the ability to show the list of recently viewed
          / edited notes and quickly jump to it.</p>
        <p>To access this functionality, click on <code>Jump to</code> button on the
          top. By default, (when nothing is entered into autocomplete), this dialog
          will show the list of recent notes.</p>
        <p>Alternatively you can click on the "time" icon on the right.</p>
