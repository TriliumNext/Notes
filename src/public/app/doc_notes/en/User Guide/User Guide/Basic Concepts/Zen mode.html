        <p>When Zen Mode is activated (pictured on the side), most of the user interface
          of Trilium is hidden away in order to be able to focus on the content,
          whether it's for reading or writing.</p>

        <h2>Activating &amp; deactivating</h2>
        <p>The Zen Mode can be activated by accessing the global menu and selecting
          the “Zen Mode” option:</p>
        <p>Aside from the global menu, it's also possible to activate this mode by
          using a keyboard shortcut which is <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> by default.
          Look for <code>toggleZenMode</code> in the shortcut configuration.</p>
        <p>Once Zen Mode is activated, all the UI elements of the application will
          be hidden away, including the global menu. In that case, the Zen Mode can
          be deactivated either by pressing the
          <img src="Zen mode_image.png">icon in the top-right corner of the window or by pressing the keyboard
          combination again.</p>
        <p>Do note that, by design, activating or deactivating the Zen Mode applies
          only to the current window. Restarting the application will also disable
          the Zen Mode.</p>
        <h2>Moving the window around</h2>
        <p>If “Native title bar” is activated, then the operating system's default
          title bar can be used to drag the window around. If deactivated, the window
          can still be moved by dragging the mouse across the top part of the window
          where the note titles are.</p>

          11 with background effects off.</p>
        <h2>Split windows and tabs</h2>
        <p>Tabs are completely hidden, however it's still possible to use keyboard
          shortcuts such as <code>firstTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> by default), <code>secondTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> by
          default). There are also some newer shortcuts such as <code>activateNextTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>)
          or <code>activatePreviousTab</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>)
          that allow easy navigation, however make sure that they are configured
          properly in the settings.</p>
        <p>For the split view of notes, there are no keyboard shortcuts at the time
          of writing, but it's still possible to have them in Zen Mode by creating
          the split while the Zen Mode is off and then reactivating it afterwards.</p>
