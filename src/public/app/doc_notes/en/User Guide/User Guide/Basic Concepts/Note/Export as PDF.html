        </p>
        <p>Screenshot of the note contextual menu indicating the “Export as PDF”
          option.</p>
        <p>On the desktop application of Trilium it is possible to export a note
          as PDF. On the server or PWA (mobile), the option is not available due
          to technical constraints and it will be hidden.</p>
        <p>To print a note, select the
          <img src="1_Export as PDF_image.png">button to the right of the note and select <em>Export as PDF</em>.</p>
        <p>Afterwards you will be prompted to select where to save the PDF file.
          Upon confirmation, the resulting PDF will be opened automatically using
          the default/system application configured for PDFs.</p>
        <p>Should you encounter any visual issues in the resulting PDF file (e.g.
          a table does not fit properly, there is cut off text, etc.) feel free to
          <a
          href="#root/OeKBfN6JbMIq/jRV1MPt4mNSP/hrC6xn7hnDq5">report the issue</a>. In this case, it's best to offer a sample note (click
            on the
            <img src="1_Export as PDF_image.png">button, select Export note → This note and all of its descendants → HTML
            in ZIP archive). Make sure not to accidentally leak any personal information.</p>
        <h2>Landscape mode</h2>
        <p>When exporting to PDF, there are no customizable settings such as page
          orientation, size, etc. However, it is possible to specify a given note
          to be printed as a PDF in landscape mode by adding the <code>#printLandscape</code> attribute
          to it (see <a href="#root/9QRytp0ZYFIf/PnO38wN0ffOA">[missing note]</a>).</p>
        <h2>Page size</h2>
        <p>By default, the resulting PDF will be in Letter format. It is possible
          to adjust it to another page size via the <code>#printPageSize</code> attribute,
          with one of the following values: <code>A0</code>, <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, <code>A3</code>, <code>A4</code>, <code>A5</code>, <code>A6</code>, <code>Legal</code>, <code>Letter</code>, <code>Tabloid</code>, <code>Ledger</code>.</p>
        <h2>Keyboard shortcut</h2>
        <p>It's possible to trigger the export to PDF from the keyboard by going
          to <em>Keyboard shortcuts</em> and assigning a key combination for the <code>exportAsPdf</code> action.</p>
