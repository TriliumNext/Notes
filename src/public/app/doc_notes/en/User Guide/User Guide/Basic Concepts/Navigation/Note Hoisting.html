        <p>Hoisting is a standard outliner feature which allows you to focus on (or
          "zoom into") a specific note and its subtree by hiding all parent and sibling
          notes. Demo:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../../Attachments/note-hoisting.gif">
        </p>
        <p>In addition to showing only this subtree, this also narrows both full
          text search and <a href="Note%20Navigation.html">“jump to note”</a> to just
          notes present in hoisted subtree.</p>
        <p>See also <a href="Workspace.html">Workspace</a> which extends this feature.</p>
