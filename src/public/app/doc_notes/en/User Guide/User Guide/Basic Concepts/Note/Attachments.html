        <p>A <a href="../Note.html">note</a> in Trilium can <em>own</em> one or more
          attachments, which can be either images or files. These attachments can
          be displayed or linked within the note that owns them.</p>
        <p>This can be especially useful to include dependencies for your <a href="../../Note%20Types/Code/Scripts.html">scripts</a>.
          The <a href="../../Advanced%20Usage/Advanced%20Showcases/Weight%20Tracker.html">Weight Tracker</a> shows
          how to use <a href="https://chartjs.org/">chartjs</a> which is attached to
          the <a href="#root/HcUYTojFohtb">script note</a>.</p>
        <p>Each note exclusively owns its attachments, meaning attachments cannot
          be shared or linked from one note to another. If an attachment link is
          copied to a different note, the attachment itself is duplicated, and the
          copies are managed independently thereafter.</p>
        <p>Attachments, especially image files, are the recommended method for embedding
          visuals in notes. It is important to link image attachments within the
          text of the owning note; otherwise, they will be automatically deleted
          after a configurable timeout period if not referenced.</p>
