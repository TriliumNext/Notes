        <p>Note is a central entity in Trilium. Main attributes of note are title
          and content.</p>

          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Trilium there's no specific "folder" note type. Any note can have children
          and thus be a folder.</p>
        <h3>Root note</h3>
        <p>There's one special note called "root note" which is root of the note
          tree. All other notes are placed below it in the structure.</p>
        <h3>Tree structure</h3>
        <p>Importantly, note itself doesn't carry information on its placement in
          note tree. See <a href="Note/Cloning%20Notes.html">cloning</a> for details.</p>
        <p>Tree structure of notes can resemble file system - but compared to that
          notes in Trilium can act as both file and directory - meaning that note
          can both have its own content and have children. "Leaf note" is a note
          which doesn't have any children.</p>
        <h3>Deleting / undeleting notes</h3>
        <p>When you delete a note in Trilium, it is actually only marked for deletion
          (soft-delete) - the actual content, title, attributes etc. are not deleted,
          only hidden.</p>
        <p>Within (by default) 7 days, it is possible to undelete these soft-deleted
          notes - open Recent Changes dialog, and you will see a list of all modified
          notes including the deleted ones. Notes available for undeletion have a
          link to do so. This is kind of "trash can" functionality known from e.g.
          Windows.</p>
        <p>Clicking an undelete will recover the note, it's content and attributes
          - note should be just as before being deleted. This action will also undelete
          note's children which have been deleted in the same action.</p>
        <p>To be able to undelete a note, it is necessary that deleted note's parent
          must be undeleted (otherwise there's no place where we can undelete it
          to). This might become a problem when you delete more notes in succession
          - the solution is then undelete in the reverse order of your deletion.</p>
        <p>After the 7 days (configurable) the notes will be "erased" - their title,
          content, revisions and attributes will be erased, and it will not be possible
          anymore to recover them (unless you restore <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Backup.html">backup</a>).</p>
