        <p>Trilium allows you to save common searches as notes within the note tree.
          The search results will appear as sub-notes under these "saved search"
          notes. Here is an example of how it works:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/saved-search-image.gif" alt="save-search">
        </p>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>By default, saved searches are stored in the day note. However, you can
          designate a different note to store saved searches by marking it with the <code>#searchHome</code> label.
          Additionally, for <a href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Navigation/Workspace.html">workspaces</a>,
          you can use the <code>#workspaceSearchHome</code> label to specify a storage
          location for saved searches within that workspace.</p>
