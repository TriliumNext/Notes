            <p>Admonitions are a way to highlight information to the reader. Other names
              for it include <em>call-outs</em> and <em>info/warning/alert boxes</em>.</p>
            <h2>Inserting a new admonition</h2>
            <h3>From the UI</h3>
            <p>In the Formatting toolbar:</p>
            <p>
              <img src="Admonitions_image.png" width="202" height="194">
            </p>
            <h3>Via the keyboard</h3>
            <p>It's possible to insert an admonition simply by typing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>!!! note</code>
              </li>
              <li><code>!!! tip</code>
              </li>
              <li><code>!!! important</code>
              </li>
              <li><code>!!! caution</code>
              </li>
              <li><code>!!! warning</code>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to that, it's also possible to type <code>!!!&nbsp;</code> followed
              by any text, case in which a default admonition type will appear (note)
              with the entered text inside it.</p>
            <h2>Interaction</h2>
            <p>By design, admonitions act very similar to block quotes.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Selecting a text and pressing the admonition button will turn that text
                into an admonition.</li>
              <li>If selecting multiple admonitions, pressing the admonition button will
                automatically merge them into one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Inside an admonition:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd> while the admonition is empty will remove
                it.</li>
              <li>Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will start a new paragraph. Pressing it twice
                will exit out of the admonition.</li>
              <li>Headings and other block content including tables can be inserted inside
                the admonition.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Types of admonitions</h2>
            <p>There are currently five types of admonitions: <em>Note</em>, <em>Tip</em>, <em>Important</em>, <em>Caution</em>, <em>Warning</em>.</p>
            <p>These types were inspired by GitHub's support for this feature and there
              are currently no plans for adjusting it or allowing the user to customize
              them.</p>
            <h2>Markdown support</h2>
            <p>The Markdown syntax for admonitions as supported by Trilium is the one
              that GitHub uses, which is as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-markdown">&gt; [!NOTE]
&gt; This is a note.

&gt; [!TIP]
&gt; This is a tip.

&gt; [!IMPORTANT]
&gt; This is a very important information.

&gt; [!CAUTION]
&gt; This is a caution.</code></pre>
            <p>There are currently no plans of supporting alternative admonition syntaxes
              such as <code>!!! note</code>.</p>
