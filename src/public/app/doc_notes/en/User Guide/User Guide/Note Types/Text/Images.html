      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Trilium supports storing and displaying images. Supported formats are
          JPEG, PNG and GIF.</p>
        <p>An image can be uploaded in the form of note's <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/Note/Attachments.html">attachment</a> or
          as a standalone <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/Navigation/Tree%20Concepts.html">note</a> placed
          into the <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/Navigation/Tree%20Concepts.html">note tree</a>.
          Its reference can be copied into a text note, in order to display it in
          the text itself.</p>
        <h2>Uploading images</h2>
        <p>To add an image to the note, simply drag it from file explorer onto the
          note editor inside Trilium and the image will be uploaded.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="8_Images_image.png">
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively you can click on block toolbar and then on "Insert image":</p>
        <p>
          <img src="6_Images_image.png">
        </p>
        <p>You can also copy and paste an image from web - the image will be (asynchronously)
          downloaded and embedded.</p>
        <h2>Configuring the images</h2>
        <p>Clicking on an image will reveal a popup with multiple options:
          <br>
          <img src="9_Images_image.png">
        </p>
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p>The first set of options configure the alignment are, in order:</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Icon</th>
              <th>Option</th>
              <th>Preview</th>
              <th>Description</th>

                <img src="1_Images_image.png">
              </td>
              <td>As the name suggests, the name can be put inside a paragraph and moved
                around similarly as if it was a block of text. Use drag &amp; drop or cut-paste
                to move it around.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="10_Images_image.png">

                <img src="2_Images_image.png">
              </td>
              <td>The image will be displayed as a block and centered, not allowing text
                in either the left or right of it.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <img src="7_Images_image.png">
              </td>
              <td>The image will be displayed to the left or the right of the text.</td>
            </tr>

              </td>
              <td>Similarly to <em>Centered image</em>, the image will be displayed as a
                block and aligned either to the left or to the right, but not allowing
                text to flow on either of its sides.</td>

<h2>Compression</h2>
        <p>Since Trilium isn't really meant to be primary storage for image data,
          it attempts to compress and resize (with pretty aggressive settings) uploaded
          images before storing them to the database. You may then notice some quality
          degradation. Basic quality settings is available in Options -&gt; Other.</p>
        <p>If you want to save images in their original resolution, it is recommended
          to save them as attachment to note (top-right "Note actions -&gt; Import
          files").</p>
