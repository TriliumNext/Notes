        <p>The code blocks feature allows entering pieces of code in text notes.</p>
        <p>Note that this feature is meant for generally small snippets of code.
          For larger files such as an entire log, see the dedicated <a href="#root/pOsGYCXsbNQG/KSZ04uQ2D1St/FVuX89AJuFSw">[missing note]</a> note
          type instead.</p>
        <h2>Inserting a code block</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Via the <a href="Formatting%20toolbar.html">Formatting toolbar</a>, look
            for the
            <img src="Code blocks_image.png">button.
            <ul>
              <li>Pressing directly on the icon will insert a code block with the language
                that was selected most recently. If this is the first time a code block
                is inserted, the language will be “Auto-detected” by default.</li>
              <li>Pressing the arrow next to the icon, which will show a popup with the
                available languages.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Type <code>```</code> (as in Markdown).
            <ul>
              <li>Note that it's not possible to specify the language, as it will default
                to the last selected language.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Syntax highlighting</h2>
        <p>Since TriliumNext v0.90.12, Trilium will try to offer syntax highlighting
          to the code block. Note that the syntax highlighting mechanism is slightly
          different than the one in <a href="../Code.html">Code Notes</a> notes as
          different technologies are involved.</p>
        <p>When the language is set to <em>Auto-detected</em>, Trilium will try to
          identify the programming language (or similar) that corresponds to the
          given snippet of text and highlight it. If this is problematic, consider
          changing the language of the code block manually.</p>
        <p>When the language is set to <em>Plain text</em>, there will be no syntax
          highlighting.</p>
        <h2>Changing the language of a code block</h2>
        <p>Simply click anywhere inside the code block and press again the code block
          button in the <a href="Formatting%20toolbar.html">Formatting toolbar</a>:
          <br>

        </p>
        <h2>Adjusting the list of languages</h2>
        <p>The code blocks feature shares the list of languages with the <a href="../Code.html">Code Notes</a> note
          type.</p>
        <p>The supported languages can be adjusted by going to <a href="../../Basic%20Concepts/UI%20Elements/Options.html">Options</a>,
          then <em>Code Notes</em> and looking for the <em>Available MIME types in the dropdown</em> section.
          Simply check any of the items to add them to the list, or uncheck them
          to remove them from the list.</p>
        <p>Note that the list of languages is not immediately refreshed, you'd have
          to manually <a href="../../Troubleshooting/Refreshing%20the%20application.html">refresh the application</a>.</p>
