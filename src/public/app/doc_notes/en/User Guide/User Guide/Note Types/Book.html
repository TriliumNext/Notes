        <p>A <strong>Book Note</strong> in Trilium is a special type of <a href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes.html">note</a> designed
          to display the contents of its child notes sequentially, creating a linear,
          book-like reading experience. This format is particularly useful for viewing
          multiple smaller notes in a cohesive, continuous manner.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the example above, the "node.js" note on the left panel contains several
          child notes. The right panel displays the content of these child notes
          as a single continuous document.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <h3>Linear Display</h3>
        <p>The Book Note format compiles the contents of all child notes into one
          continuous view. This makes it ideal for reading extensive information
          broken into smaller, manageable segments.</p>
        <h3>Grid View Option</h3>
        <p>Trilium also offers a "Grid View" option within the Book Note properties.
          This view presents the child notes in a grid format, allowing for a more
          visual navigation experience.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="Book_image.png">
        </p>
        <p>Switching between these views can be easily managed through the Book Note's
          settings (or <code>viewType</code> attribute), allowing users to choose the
          format that best suits their reading or navigation preferences.</p>
