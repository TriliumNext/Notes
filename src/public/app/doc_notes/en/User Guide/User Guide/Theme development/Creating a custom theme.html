        <h2>Step 1. Find a place to place the themes</h2>
        <p>Organization is an important aspect of managing a knowledge base. When
          developing a new theme or importing an existing one it's a good idea to
          keep them into one place.</p>
        <p>As such, the first step is to create a new note to gather all the themes.</p>
        <p>![](4_Creating%20a custom theme_im.png)</p>
        <h2>Step 2. Create the theme</h2>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th></th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <img src="Creating a custom theme_im.png">
              </td>
              <td>Themes are code notes with a special attribute. Start by creating a new
                code note.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>![](Creating%20a%20custom theme_im.png)</td>
              <td>Then change the note type to a CSS code.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>![](5_Creating%20a%20custom theme_im.png)</td>
              <td>In the <em>Owned Attributes</em> section define the <code>#appTheme</code> attribute
                to point to any desired name. This is the name that will show up in the
                appearance section in settings.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        
<h2>Step 3. Define the theme's CSS</h2>
        <p>As a very simple example we will change the background color of the launcher
          pane to a shade of blue.</p>
        <p>To alter the different variables of the theme:</p><pre><code class="language-text-css">:root {
	--launcher-pane-background-color: #0d6efd;
}</code></pre>
        <h2>Step 4. Activating the theme</h2>
        <p>Refresh the application (Ctrl+Shift+R is a good way to do so) and go to
          settings. You should see the newly created theme:</p>
        <p>![](1_Creating%20a%20custom theme_im.png)</p>
        <p>Afterwards the application will refresh itself with the new theme:</p>
        <p>![](3_Creating%20a%20custom theme_im.png)</p>
        <p>Do note that the theme will be based off of the legacy theme. To override
          that and base the theme on the new TriliumNext theme, see:Â <a href="Customize%20the%20Next%20theme.html">Theme base (legacy vs. next)</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Step 5. Making changes</h2>
        <p>Simply go back to the note and change according to needs. To apply the
          changes to the current window, press Ctrl+Shift+R to refresh.</p>
        <p>It's a good idea to keep two windows, one for editing and the other one
          for previewing the changes.</p>
