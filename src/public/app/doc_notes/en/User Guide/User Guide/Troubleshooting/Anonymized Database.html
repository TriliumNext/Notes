        <p>In certain scenarios, understanding the structure of a database is crucial
          for troubleshooting issues. However, sharing your actual <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Database.html">database</a> file
          with personal notes is not advisable. To address this, Trilium offers a
          feature to anonymize the database. This feature can be accessed via Menu
          -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced tab.</p>
        <p>This feature creates a copy of your database with all sensitive data removed.
          Specifically, it strips out note titles, contents, revisions, history,
          and some non-system attributes while retaining the overall structure and
          metadata, such as modification dates. After anonymization, the database
          undergoes a <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html">vacuuming process</a> to
          ensure no sensitive data remnants remain in the file. The anonymized database
          is saved in the <code>anonymized</code> directory within the <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">data directory</a>,
          making it safe to share with bug reports.</p>
        <p>This will create a copy of your document and remove all sensitive data
          (currently note titles, contents, revisions, history and some of the options,
          and non-system attributes) while leaving all structure and metadata (e.g.
          date of last change). After this is done, the database is <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html">VACUUMed</a> to
          make sure there's no stale sensitive data in the document file. The resulting
          file is stored in <code>anonymized</code> directory (placed in the <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">data directory</a>).
          You can safely attach it to a bug report.</p>
        <h2>Command Line Anonymization</h2>
        <p>If your <a href="../Advanced%20Usage/Database.html">database</a> is corrupted
          to the point where Trilium cannot start, the anonymization process can
          still be executed via the command line:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-trilium-auto">node src/anonymize.js</code></pre>
        <p>Run this command from the directory containing Trilium's source files,
          typically found in the <code>resources/app</code> directory for desktop builds.</p>
