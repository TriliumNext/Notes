        <p>It's important to provide all available error logs together with bug reports.
          This page will show you how to do it.</p>
        <h2>Backend logs</h2>
        <p>Open <a href="../Installation%20%26%20Setup/Data%20directory.html">data directory</a>,
          go to <code>log</code> subdirectory and find the latest log file, e.g. <code>trilium-2022-12-14.log</code>.
          You can attach the whole file to the bug report (preferable) or open it
          and copy-paste only the last lines / lines you believe are relevant.</p>
        <p>If you have trouble finding it the log files, there's also an in-app option
          in top-left menu button -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Show backend log.</p>
        <h2>Frontend logs</h2>
        <p>To provide frontend logs, we need to open the Developer Console. Often
          the easiest way is to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>I</kbd> which
          should work in most browsers (and desktop app). Make sure that the error
          producing action happened right before you copy&amp;paste the errors, the
          console is cleared on app restart.</p>
        <p>If that doesn't work, then:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>in Trilium desktop app, go to top-left menu button -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
            Open Dev Tools</li>
          <li>In Firefox/Chrome right-click anywhere in the page and click Inspect:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <img src="../Attachments/error-logs-firefox-context.png">
        </p>
        <p>Once you have Dev Tools open, click on "Console" tab:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="Error logs_image.png">
        </p>
        <p>Copy-paste (or screenshot) the logs. It's better to provide not just errors,
          but the whole log, which might provide context while analyzing the bug.</p>
        <h2>Providing sensitive data</h2>
        <p>If you don't feel comfortable attaching the logs or anything sensitive
          to the public GitHub issues, feel free to contact the devs in our Matrix
          <a
          href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Notes#-discuss-with-us">support channel</a>.</p>
        <p>Use this email to also provide anything which could assist in analysing
          the bug - e.g. files/images/ZIPs being imported or <a href="Anonymized%20Database.html">anonymized database</a>.</p>
        <h3>Exporting note subtree for reproduction</h3>
        <p>Often times, bugs manifest themselves in specific notes and having them
          would greatly ease reproduction and fixing.</p>
        <p>In such case, please export the relevant note subtree by right-clicking
          it on the left tree, choosing Export - HTML as ZIP:</p>
